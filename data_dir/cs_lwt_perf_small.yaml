### Batch Ratio Distribution Specifications ###

# Insert is used only to propagate data into the dataset. This is only query that supports batches,
#   it is actually works only thru batches.
# In order to call it add it to the ops statement: 'ops(insert=1,...)'
# It overrides custom query 'insert' if it is defined
# batch size maximum is hardcoded to 65535, it can be limiting row number in partition for
#   big row insertation, by setting 'partitions' key to fixed(X)

insert: # SchemaInsert.java, does batched prepared statements insert
  partitions: fixed(4)
  select:    fixed(4)/10240M
  batchtype: UNLOGGED

# After running "ops(insert=1) n=1000000" you will get ~1m records with ~76 avg row size
#   across ~847k partitions, table size will be ~73m
